## Background

A draft manuscript by Serge Gofas titled:

**[A worldwide geographical scheme for recording the distribution of marine biota](./background_v2_2022-11.md)**

has been posted to describe the need and a proposed strategy for developing a scheme of marine regions comparable to the TDWG standard for terrestrial regions. The intention is to submit this manucript (authored by all participants of the task group) for publication after comments are incorporated and a consensus is reached on the goals and approach.

## Resources:

  - Named marine areas - proposal for Level 4 units posted here in the form of 5 Excel spreadsheets (one file for each Level 1 ocean, one tab in each file for each Level 2 unit), also on the [Google Drive of the Marine interest group](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uwi264hKIMHZlLpfMY2wQyRvnXG_1TvY)
  - Geospatial representations of named areas are not part of the proposed standard, but kml files available on the Google Drive repository.
