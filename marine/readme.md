## Background

The abovementioned convenors have been (as of November 2023)  endorsed by the Executive Committee as a Task Group to pursue the goal of elaborating a set of marine units as  equivalent to the current World Gregraphic Schenme for the Representation of Plant Distributions. 

## Resources:

A paper describing the proposal is in press at *Biodiversity Data Journal* with title **A worldwide geographical scheme for recording the distribution of marine biota: proposal and call for feedback**, with three items of supplementary material also posted here

- a background document (./background_v3_2025-07.md) to describe the need and a proposed strategy for developing a scheme of marine regions comparable to the TDWG standard for terrestrial regions. 

- a detailed description of the proposal (./proposal_v2_2024-12.md) for Level 1, Level 2 and Level 4 coastal units with all proposed geounits illustrated by maps.

- an Excel file with the complete list of proposed geounits (level 1 to Level 4) and the sources to be used for the associated shapefiles (./Geoschemes_marine_proposal_12_2024.xls)

Due to issues with the coastline (the representation of which is not exactly coincident in the marine and terrestrial schemes), it was decided that the geospatial representations of named areas are not part of the proposed standard.
