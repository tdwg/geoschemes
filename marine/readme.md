## Background

A draft manuscript by Serge Gofas titled:

**[A worldwide geographical scheme for recording the distribution of marine biota](./background.md)**

has been posted here for review and comment.  It describes the need and a proposed strategy for developing a scheme of marine regions comparable to the TDWG standard for terrestrial regions. The intention is to submit this manucript for publication after comments are incorporated and a consensus is reached on the goals and approach.

## Resources:

  - Named marine regions -- expected in early 2023
  - Geospatial representations of named regions (e.g., shape files) -- expected in mid 2023
