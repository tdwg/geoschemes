## Background

A draft manuscript by Serge Gofas titled:

**[A worldwide geographical scheme for recording the distribution of marine biota](./background.md)**

has been posted here for review and comment.  It describes the need and a proposed strategy for developing a scheme of marine regions comparable to the TDWG standard for terrestrial regions. The intention is to submit this manucript (authored by all participants of the task group) for publication after comments are incorporated and a consensus is reached on the goals and approach.

## Resources:

  - Named marine areas -- to be posted in the form of Excel spreadsheets (alteady posted for Atlantic Ocean) here and on the [Google Drive of the Marine interest group] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uwi264hKIMHZlLpfMY2wQyRvnXG_1TvY)
  - Geospatial representations of named areas are not part of the proposed standard, kml files available on the Google Drive repository.
