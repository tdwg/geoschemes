## Background

A draft manuscript by Serge Gofas titled:

**[A worldwide geographical scheme for recording the distribution of marine biota](./background_v2_2022-11.md)**

has been posted to describe the need and a proposed strategy for developing a scheme of marine regions comparable to the TDWG standard for terrestrial regions. The abovementioned convenors have now (as of November 2023) been endorsed by the Executive Committee as a Task Group to pursue this goal.

## Resources:

  - Named marine areas - proposal for Level 4 units posted here in the form of 5 Excel spreadsheets (one file for each Level 1 ocean, one tab in each file for each Level 2 unit), also on the [Google Drive of the Marine interest group](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uwi264hKIMHZlLpfMY2wQyRvnXG_1TvY). **[A detailed description of the proposal](./proposal_v1_2023-10.md)** for Level 1, Level 2 and Level 4 coastal units has been posted ans is intended for public distribution and call for feedback. 
- Due to issues with the coastline (the representation of which is not exactly coincident in the marine and terrestrial schemes), it was decided that the geospatial representations of named areas are not part of the proposed standard. Some kml files, which can easily be visualized on Google Earth, are nevertheless available on the Google Drive repository for convenience. 

## Further developments:

- Pending actions include the treatment of the High Seas at levels 3 and 4, the definition of Level 3 coastal units, and the elaboration of codes for Level 3 and Level 4 units.
