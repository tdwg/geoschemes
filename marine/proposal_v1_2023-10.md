# A worldwide geographical scheme for recording the distribution of marine biota: First draft (October 2023) of the proposal.

The proposal for a marine scheme features five Level 1 units, 26 Level-2 units and 430 coastal Level 4 units (compare to 9 Level 1, 52 Level 2 and 609 Level 4 in the current terrestrial scheme). Level 3 units and the Level 4 units for High Seas are yet to be defined. This draft proposal is here posted with the purpose of gathering feedback. It is summarized on the following maps, organized according to the Level 1 and Level 2 units in which they are comprised, followed by notes explaining some of the options taken. Level 4 units for the coastal area (i.e. jurisdictional waters to the 200 NM boundary) are detailed in five Excel files posed on this site (one Excel file for each Level 1 ocean, then one tab for each Level 2 region in that ocean).

## Higher level units 

### Level 1 units

Level 1 units are the five oceans. Marginal seas (which are treated in the IHO scheme with same rank as the major oceans) are appended to the major oceans following the [boundaries set by NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/sites/g/files/anmtlf171/files/2023-01/World%20Ocean%20Volumes.pdf)  (Eakins & Sharman, 2010, see also background document) although other sources (e.g. Wikipedia) show slightly different groupings. Limits of proposed Level 1 units are then adjusted to the nearest Level 4 unit, therefore departing from IHO boundaries (see at the end of this document for the detail of these adjustments). Taking into account that the terrestrial Level 1 units used up single-digit codes 1 thru 9, the code for marine Level 1 units is here proposed as single-letter.

### Level 2 units

Level 2 units in the coastal area correspond to the realms of Spalding et al. (2007) Marine Ecoregions of the World, defined therein as “very large regions (...) across which biotas are internally coherent at higher taxonomic levels, as a result of a shared and unique evolutionary history”. Their seaward limit is adjusted to the 200 NM, and also adjusted to the nearest Level 4 unit. Those realms which, in the MEOW system, straddle the limits of Level 1 oceans (the case of Temperate South America, Temperate Southern Africa, Temperate Australasia, and Subantarctic Islands), are subdivided accordingly. Eastern and Western parts of Temperate Northern Atlantic and Tropical Atlantic are also distinguished at Level 2. High Seas constitute an additional Level 2 unit in each Level 1 ocean. Codes for Level 2 regions will use a two-character format (the ocean’s letter and one digit).

### Level 3 units

Level 3 units are not yet established. They are to be identical to Level 4 when there is no obvious grouping. Examples of obvious groupings are the lesser Antilles or the "provincial bioregions" among Australian IMCRA regions.

## Level 4: Basic recording units

Level 4 units never encompass the jurisdictional waters of more than one country or territory. For those countries with large and/or complex jurisdictional water, these are systematically split into as many units as there are Level 1 or Level 2 units involved (e.g. Costa Rica, Guatemala, albeit small, has one Pacific and one Caribbean unit; South Africa has one Atlantic and two Indian Ocean units). 

In addition to this, some large EEZs (e.g. Brazil, Indonesia) are subdivided even if they are entirely contained in the same Level 2 unit; by default, the partition is done along the limits of ecoregions in the MEOW system of Spalding et al. (2007). Exceptions are places where there is a well-established local system of geounits with associated shapefiles: for Europe: the subregions defined for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD; Jensen et al. 2017); for Australia, the IMCRA regions (Commonwealth of Australia. 2006)  and places where the MEOW ecoregions have been declared inadequate (e.g. Madagascar, Cooke et al. 2022).

### Arctic Ocean coastal units

This Level 1 area comprises only one Level 2 coastal unit

> Notes

> Canada has defined (Department of Fisheries and Oceans, 2009) twelve marine bioregions, four of which (Strait of Georgia, Southern Shelf, Northern Shelf and Offshore Pacific) correspond to the small Pacific facade. For the Arctic and North Atlantic, the units are similar to, but not coincident, with the MEOW (Figure 4). For the sake of consistency with the rest of the proposal, the boundaries of the MEOW ecoregions are used to subdivide the Arctic Canadian EEZ. In the case of Russia, the MEOW ecoregions correspond to the marginal seas of the Arctic (Barentz, White Sea, Kara, Laptev, East Siberian Sea, Chuckchi Sea) largely used by Russian authors.

> Notes
> 
> For United States, the terrestrial scheme uses 49 states, not relevant for the marine scheme because some states (e.g.  Florida, California) span important biogeographic boundaries. The molluscan database [Malacolog](http://www.malacolog.org) (Rosenberg, 2009) uses a per-state scheme but there does not seem to exist an established subdivision of the United States EEZ into parts corresponding to each state. Here the proposed option for Canada and United States is to subdivide the large Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific facades according to the MEOW ecoregion boundaries.

> Notes:
>
> Europe comprises many countries with a large and/or complex maritime facade which requires splitting. The administrative boundaries used in the context of the E.U. Marine Strategies Framework Directive (Jensen, Panagiotidis & Reker, 2017) overcome this problem and are highly suitable as “Basic Recording Units”. For Spain, these polygons have been used for the establishment of an official reference list of all marine organisms present in the country, issued in 2017 (but unfortunately withdrawn in 2020). Therefore, it may be taken as a rule that EEZs of European countries which span more than one of the 10 MSFD regions (Figure 7) are split accordingly. This applies to France, Spain, Italy, Greece, Germany, Sweden and Norway, and can be extended to the United Kingdom even if not longer part of the EU. Given the geographic extension and relative homogeneity, EEZs are directly appropriate for Denmark and Albania even if they straddle two regions.

>
> Italy has a specific regionalization designed for recording species in Fauna d’Italia (Relini, 2008). However there are several issues (1) Sector 2 does not distinguish between Sardinia (W Med and Tyrrhenian) and the central Tyrrhenian mainland, whereas both distributions and literature sources are somewhat distinct, (2) Sector 3 straddles Western Mediterranean and Central Mediterranean coasts of Sicily which are in different MSFD subregions and (3) nine sectors are too much at a worldwide scale. For these reasons, and for homogeneity with the other larger countries of the southern EU, the intersection of the 3 MSFD subregions with the Italian potential EEZ are retained. 
>
> There are several important overlapping claims (Portugal/Spain over the Selvagens, France/Spain over Bay of Biscay and Golfe du Lion, Greece/Turkey over Kastelorizo and the Eastern Aegean Sea) which could be either left as overlaps or the overlapping parts treated as separate units. A decision is also to be made on occupied territories (N Cyprus, Crimea, Gaza): should we treat them as separate of use the “legitimate” EEZs?

*Figure 8. The proposed Level 4 units for the coastal Atlantic Western tropical realm*

> Notes
>
> The proposal for the tropical Western Atlantic is quite straightforward because most countries are small and their EEZs needs no subdivision. There is a possible issue regarding whether several small islets belonging to Colombia should be lumped with the main EEZ or considered separately (some of them under joint regime must anyway be considered separately). The large Brazilian EEZ is subdivided according to the MEOW boundaries (six in the tropical realm, two in temperate).

*Figure 9. The proposed Level 4 units for the coastal Atlantic Western tropical realm*

> Notes
>
> For West Africa, the proposal uses directly the subdivisions of Caballero-Herrera et al. (2022) for the regionalization of coastal West Africa. Most countries are represented as their EEZ, but for Mauritania, the temperate area around Cap Blanc is segregated; for Senegal the disjunct northern and southern (Casamance) parts are considered separately. The Angolan EEZ is subdivided to reflect the large amount of biota endemic to the southern part. A small part of the southernmost Angolan EEZ is also segregated to be consistent with the limits of temperate southern Africa MEOW Realm, supported by the data of Caballero-Herrera et al. (2022). Alternately, this could be ignored and te latter realm limited to Namaqua and Namibian EEZ.

> Notes 
>
> The sea surrounding Madagascar is large and diverse so as to command subdivisions. Nevertheless the MEOW subdivision is inadequate because it does not single out the “Deep South” which harbours very distinctive biota (Philippe Bouchet pers. comm. 2023). Therefore, the proposed Level 4 units follow Cooke et al. (2023)

> Notes
>
> For Australia, there are only seven (the states) Level 4 units in the terrestrial TDWG scheme but the marine realm is complex. No less than 18 MEOW are defined in Australian waters (Spalding et al., 2007, see background document). An alternative scheme is provided with the “Integrated Marine and Coastal Regionalisation of Australia” [IMCRA 4.0 with 36 Provincial Bioregions](https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/2660e2d2-7623-459d-bcab-1110265d2c86/files/map1-pb.pdf) (Commonwealth of Australia. 2006) which departs from an EEZ-based scheme by considering separately the shallow coastal regions and the remainder of the EEZ. However, it has the advantage of being a coherent system whose outer boundaries are exactly coincident with Australian EEZ. The designation of six marine regions (Figure 15 A; North, Coral Sea, Temperate East, South-east, South-west and North-west) in support of the [Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, 1999](https://soe.environment.gov.au/theme/marine-environment/topic/2016/marine-regions) was supposedly informed by the provincial bioregions identified as part of an earlier version of the IMCRA, but the boundaries are not exactly coincident. This scheme departs from traditional Australian marine biogeographical regions (Figure 15 B) and even from the classification into “temperate” and “tropical” suggested in the IMCRA scheme (Figure 14).  
>
> IMCRA regions are used for display in the [Australian Faunal Directory](https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/home), whereas [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au/) uses only point data for the display on species factsheets but uses the IMCRA regions as bounding box for [search within an area ](http://regions.ala.org.au/#rt=States+and+territories). A further reason for adopting them as Level 4 units is that, despite their number, their extension is similar to that of Level 4 units elsewhere e.g. Europe whereas the Australian EEZ  is one of the largest in the world 
>
> Groupings can be made at Level 3. The most important is to respect the contrast between temperate and tropical parts (Poore & O’Hara 2007; Ahyong, 2017; Gary Poore, pers. comm. 2021) which, intersected with Level 1 oceans, would define four subdivisions. The suggested groups at Level 3 largely follow the IMCRA 4 scheme proper (tropical, temperate and cold) with Indian and Pacific parts separated, and remote islands (Cocos-Keeling, Christmas, Macquairie, Lord Howe, Norfolk) treated as separate units.

> Notes
>
> The essential points not to be missed  regarding Japan are that (1) the Japan Sea has a perturbed recent geological history (Amano, 2004) and must be considered separately from the East coast and (2) the cold current sweeping the NE coast marks an important boundary at Chōshi (central Honshū, Figure 17A). Then, the remote southern islands (Ogasawara or Bonin Islands) must be considered separately, they hold a tropical fauna which belong to the Central Indo-Pacific M<EOW realm and may not occur in the rest of Japanese seas. Several of the MEOW (Figure 17B) are shared with Russia or Korea and must be trimmed to Japanese waters but are otherwise fine to describe the area. MEOW 122 lumps the remote Minami-Tori-Shima (Marcus Is.) with the other Ogasawara islands, and apparently Japanese authors also do so, but they are so remote and physically separated that they are better distinguished; the EEZ surrounding Okino-Tori-Shima is not included in the MEOW system and should be added, albeit it is disputed whether this uninhabited island can trigger an EEZ.

> For Indonesia, the terrestrial scheme has basic recording units corresponding to the main islands or island groups. For the marine part, MEOWs (Figure 19), with adjustments to fit the Indonesian EEZ, seem a reasonable option. Eleven MEOWs account for the Indonesian seas, four of them pertaining mostly to the Indian Ocean, the remaining to marginal seas associated to the Pacific Ocean.

### Southern Ocean Level 4 coastal units

In Antarctica, levels of endemism among molluscs, decapods, ascidians, sponges, polychaetes, and shore fishes range from about 42% to 88%, but there seems no support for provincial endemism within the region (Griffiths et al., 2009). As a default solution the MEOW subdivision is used for the 200 NM zone surrounding Antarctiva (which is not an EEZ).

## Additional notes

### Adjustment of limits of Level 1 unis departing from the IHO scheme

Arctic/Atlantic: Sea areas corresponding to coastal MEOWs 3 (East Greenland Shelf), 4 (West Greenland Shelf), 5 (Northern Grand Banks–Southern Labrador) and 6 (Northern Labrador) to be included in Arctic Level 1 unit, to be consistent with Level 2 “Arctic” MEOW realm which includes those ecoregions. Norwegian EEZ, United Kingdom EEZ and Faeroe Islands EEZ left out, to be consistent with Level 2 “Temperate North Atlantic” MEOW realm 

Arctic/Pacific: Russia - Bering Sea and Alaska – Bering Sea to be included, to be consistent with Level 2 “Arctic” MEOW realm.

Atlantic/Pacific: Chilean part of the South Atlantic Ocean included with Level 1 Pacific, to avoid a small Atlantic subdivision of Chilean EEZ.

Atlantic/Southern Ocean: Overlapping claim South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands: UK / Argentina  included in Southern Ocean Level  unit.

Atlantic/Indian Ocean: South Africa – Agulhas EEZ  corresponding to MEOW 192. Agulhas Bank (MRGid 21806) included with Indian Ocean Level 1 unit.

Pacific/Indian Ocean: Australian IMCRA provinces “Northern Shelf Province” left out of Pacific Level 1 unit, and “Northeast Shelf Transition” included. “Tasmania Province” and “Tasmanian Shelf Province” and “Bass Strait” IMCRA provinces included with Pacific Level 1 unit. Thailand West coast EEZ included in Indian Ocean Level 1 unit. 

### Genealogy of shapefiles 

Shapefiles used to visualize proposed Level 4 units were derived from the Flanders Marine Institute (2019). Maritime Boundaries Geodatabase: [Maritime Boundaries and Exclusive Economic Zones (200NM), version 11]( https://doi.org/10.14284/386). Nevertheless, there is an issue with the coastlines not exactly coincident with the outline of terrestrial regions on the WGSRPD, therefore the associated shapefiles (and derived kml files) are not proposed as part of the standard but only as a tool for visualisation in a GIS . The proposed standard will only include the conceptual definition (e.g. “Guinea – EEZ”; “Brazil – intersection of EEZ with MEOW 72. Amazonia, adjusted to 200 NM limit”). 

The [MEOW shapefiles from TNC](https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/903c3ae05b264c00a3b5e58a4561b7e6/data) were used only as a template for placing the MEOW limits when those are used to subdivide large countries. Reasons are that (1) their inner limit is placed way inland, and must be trimmed against a shapefile of the baseline (2) the outer limit is not 200 nm but an approximate contour and (3) terms of use include the commitment that “... you are using the data for non-commercial purposes, and you don't alter them in any way.” whereas we adjust them to EEZs.

For Europe (MSFD subregions) and Australia (IMCRA regions), original shapefiles are available from those respective sources.

### Syntax for geounits names

The name should start always with the country name e.g. France - Bay of Biscay, not “French part of the Bay of Biscay”. Some users dislike adjectives, which are sometimes awkward to pick in the pull-down menu.

Remote parts and/or dependent states e.g. Martinique are named on their own when they have an ISO code distinct from the ruling country (e.g. Martinique [ISO code: MQ, not FR of mainland France]), not when the ISO code is the same (e.g. Spain – Demarcación marina Canaria [ISO code: ES like mainland Spain])

Decisions are to be made on the treatment of overlapping claims resulting from unsettled borders. Currently these (e.g. France/Spain in Bay of Biscay, Spain/Portugal in the Selvagem islands) are appended to both adjacent geounits which therefore overlap, not treated as separate units (issue to be confirmed – considered so in preliminary discussions of the DWG but issues with summing up surfaces). Overlapping claims over an entire territory are already treated as a separate geounit (e.g. the Falkland Islands). 

Basic recording units are therefore named according to this pattern:

Country – EEZ (complete EEZ of the country; use instead “Jurisdictional waters” when no EEZ is declared (Mediterranean)?)

Country – Region EEZ or Country – IHOarea EEZ when a large or complex EEZ has been subdivided according to IHO (i.e. placetype “Marine Region”), MEOW or other scheme. 

Country – MSFD subzone where applicable in Europe (omit “EEZ” in this case, the names involve sea areas)

Australia – IMCRA provincial bioregion where applicable

The mention of EEZ in the proposed name of marine geounits is needed because otherwise, there is confusion with terrestrial geounits with the same name. It may be omitted is the part is explicitly a sea area (e.g. Saudi Arabia – Red Sea)
